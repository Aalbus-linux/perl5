# Perl 5 Doesn't Use GitHub!

## This is just a mirror!

Perl 5 development happens on the
[perl5-porters](http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html) mailing list, in
the [perl5 request tracker](https://rt.perl.org/), and the [perl5 git
repository](http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git).

The GitHub mirror is *just a mirror*.  We can't turn off pull requests, though.
This means that you can *try* to file a pull request here, but it won't be
handled the same way, and you'll probably end up wondering what's up.

Perl](/pod/perlhack.pod).
