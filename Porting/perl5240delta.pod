=head1 NAME

perl5240delta - what is new for perl v5.24.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the 5.22.0 release and the
5.24.0 release.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Unicode 8.0 is now supported

For details on what is in this release, see
L<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/>.

=head2 C<qr/(?[ ])/> now works in UTF-8 locales

L<Extended Bracketed Character Classes|perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes>
now will successfully compile when S<C<use locale>> is in effect.  The compiled
pattern will use standard Unicode rules.  If the runtime locale is not a
UTF-8 one, a warning is raised and standard Unicode rules are used
anyway.  No tainting is done since the outcome does not actually depend
on the locale.

=head2 Integer shift (C<< << >> and C<< >> >>) now more explicitly defined

Negative shifts are reverse shifts: left shift becomes right shift,
and right shift becomes left shift.

Shifting by the number of bits in a native integer (or more) is zero,
except when the "overshift" is right shifting a negative value under
C<use integer>, in which case the result is -1 (arithmetic shift).

Until now negative shifting and overshifting have been undefined
because they have relied on whatever the C implementation happens
to do.  For example, for the overshift a common C behavior is
"modulo shift":

  1 >> 64 == 1 >> (64 % 64) == 1 >> 0 == 1  # Common C behavior.

  # And the same for <<, while Perl now produces 0 for both.

Now these behaviors are well-defined under Perl, regardless of what
the underlying C implementation does.  Note, however, that you cannot
escape the native integer width, you need to know how far left you
can go.  You can use for example:

  use Config;
  my $wordbits = $Config{uvsize} * 8;  # Or $Config{uvsize} << 3.

If you need a more bits on the left shift, you can use for example
the C<bigint> pragma, or the C<Bit::Vector> module from CPAN.

=head2 Postfix dereferencing is no longer experimental

Using the C<postderef> and C<postderef_qq> features no longer emits a
warning. Existing code that disables the C<experimental::postderef> warning
category that they previously used will continue to work. The C<postderef>
feature has no effect; all Perl code can use postfix dereferencing,
regardless of what feature declarations are in scope. The C<5.24> feature
bundle now includes the C<postderef_qq> feature.

=head2 printf and sprintf now allow reordered precision arguments

That is, C<< sprintf '|%.*2$|', 2, 3 >> now returns C<|002|>. This extends
the existing reordering mechanism (which allows reordering for arguments
that are used as format fields, widths, and vector separators).

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Nested declarations are now disallowed

A C<my>, C<our>, or C<state> declaration is no longer allowed inside
of another C<my>, C<our>, or C<state> declaration.

For example, these are now fatal:

   my ($x, my($y));
   our (my $x);

L<[perl #125587]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125587>

L<[perl #121058]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121058>

=head2 The C</\C/> character class has been removed.

This regular expression character class was deprecated in v5.20.0 and has
produced a deprecation warning since v5.22.0. It is now a compile-time
error. If you need to examine the individual bytes that make up a
UTF8-encoded character, then use C<utf8::encode()> on the string (or a
copy) first.

=head2 C<chdir('')> no longer chdirs home

Using C<chdir('')> or C<chdir(undef)> to chdir home has been deprecated since
perl v5.8, and will now fail.  Use C<chdir()> instead.

=head2 ASCII characters in variable names must now be all visible

It was legal until now on ASCII platforms for variable names to contain
non-graphical ASCII control characters (ordinals 0 through 31, and 127,
which are the C0 controls and C<DELETE>).  This usage has been
deprecated since v5.20, and as of now causes a syntax error.  The
variables these names referred to are special, reserved by Perl for
whatever use it may choose, now, or in the future.  Each such variable
has an alternative way of spelling it.  Instead of the single
non-graphic control character, a two character sequence beginning with a
caret is used, like C<$^]> and C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE}>.  Details are at
L<perlvar>.   It remains legal, though unwise and deprecated (raising a
deprecation warning), to use certain non-graphic non-ASCII characters in
variables names when not under S<C<use utf8>>.  No code should do this,
as all such variables are reserved by Perl, and Perl doesn't currently
define any of them (but could at any time, without notice).

=head2 The C<autoderef> feature has been removed

The experimental C<autoderef> feature (which allowed calling C<push>,
C<pop>, C<shift>, C<unshift>, C<splice>, C<keys>, C<values>, and C<each> on
a scalar argument) has been deemed unsuccessful. It has now been removed;
trying to use the feature (or to disable the C<experimental::autoderef>
warning it previously triggered) now yields an exception.

=head2 An off by one issue in C<$Carp::MaxArgNums> has been fixed

C<$Carp::MaxArgNums> is supposed to be the number of arguments to display.
Prior to this version, it was instead showing C<$Carp::MaxArgNums> + 1 arguments,
contrary to the documentation.

=head2 Lexical $_ has been removed

C<my $_> was introduced in Perl 5.10, and subsequently caused much confusion
with no obvious solution.  In Perl 5.18.0, it was made experimental on the
theory that it would either be removed or redesigned in a less confusing (but
backward-incompatible) way.  Over the following years, no alternatives were
proposed.  The feature has now been removed and will fail to compile.

=head2 Only blanks and tabs are now allowed within C<[...]> within C<(?[...])>.

The experimental Extended Bracketed Character Classes can contain regular
bracketed character classes within them.  These differ from regular ones in
that white space is generally ignored, unless escaped by preceding it with a
backslash.  The white space that is ignored is now limited to just tab C<\t>
and SPACE characters.  Previously, it was any white space.  See
L<perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes>.

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 sysread(), syswrite(), recv() and send() are deprecated on
:utf8 handles

The sysread(), recv(), syswrite() and send() operators
are deprecated on handles that have the C<:utf8> layer, either
explicitly, or implicitly, eg., with the C<:encoding(UTF-16LE)> layer.

Both sysread() and recv() currently use only the C<:utf8> flag for the
stream, ignoring the actual layers.  Since sysread() and recv() do no
UTF-8 validation they can end up creating invalidly encoded scalars.

Similarly, syswrite() and send() use only the C<:utf8> flag, otherwise
ignoring any layers.  If the flag is set, both write the value UTF-8
encoded, even if the layer is some different encoding, such as the
example above.

Ideally, all of these operators would completely ignore the C<:utf8>
state, working only with bytes, but this would result in silently
breaking existing code.  To avoid this a future version of perl will
throw an exception when any of sysread(), recv(), syswrite() or send()
are called on handle with the C<:utf8> layer.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Creating Perl debugger data structures (see L<perldebguts/"Debugger Internals">)
for XSUBs and const subs has been removed.  This removed one glob/scalar combo
for each unique C<.c> file that XSUBs and const subs came from.  On startup
(C<perl -e"0">) about half a dozen glob/scalar debugger combos were created.
Loading XS modules created more glob/scalar combos.  These things were created
regardless if the perl debugger was being used or not, unlike for pure perl
subs, and ignores that the perl debugger can not debug C code.

=item *

Single arguments in list assign are now slightly faster:

  ($x) = (...);
  (...) = ($x);

=item *

C</fixed-substr/> has been made much faster.

On platforms with a libc memchr() implementation which makes good use of
underlying hardware support, patterns which include fixed substrings will now
often be much faster; for example with glibc on a recent x86_64 CPU, this:

    $s = "a" x 1000 . "wxyz";
    $s =~ /wxyz/ for 1..30000

is now about 7 times faster.  On systems with slow memchr(), e.g. 32-bit ARM
Raspberry Pi, there will be a small or little speedup.  Conversely, some
pathological cases, such as C<"ab" x 1000 =~ /aa/> will be slower now; up to 3
times slower on the rPi, 1.5x slower on x86_64.

=item *

Faster addition, subtraction and multiplication.

Since 5.8.0, arithmetic became slower due to the need to support
64-bit integers. To deal with 64-bit integers, a lot more corner
cases need to be checked, which adds time. We now detect common
cases where there is no need to check for those corner cases,
and special-case them.

=item *

Faster preincrement, predecrement, postincrement, postdecrement.

By internally splitting the functions which handled multiple
cases into different functions.

L<%s() is deprecated on :utf8 handles|perldiag/"%s() is deprecated on :utf8 handles">

(W deprecated) The sysread(), recv(), syswrite() and send() operators
are deprecated on handles that have the C<:utf8> layer, either
explicitly, or implicitly, eg., with the C<:encoding(UTF-16LE)> layer.

Both sysread() and recv() currently use only the C<:utf8> flag for the

Similarly, syswrite() and send() use only the C<:utf8> flag, otherwise

when command line options are ignored for no obvious reason.  C<-O> is now
permitted, but ignored.

Some filesystem stat symbols which were not used by the Perl core

=item MacOS X

=over

=item *

Until now OS X builds of perl have specified a link target of 10.3 (Panther,
2003) but have not specified a compiler target.  From now on, builds of perl on
OS X 10.6 or later (Snow Leopard, 2008) by default capture the current OS X
version and specify that as the explicit build target in both compiler and
linker flags, thus preserving binary compatibility for extensions built later
regardless of changes in OS X, SDK, or compiler and linker versions.  To
override the default value used in the build and preserved in the flags,
specify C<export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.N> before configuring and building
perl, where 10.N is the version of OS X you wish to target.  In OS X 10.5 or
earlier there is no change to the behavior present when those systems were
current; the link target is still OS X 10.3 and there is no explicit compiler
target.

Perl now implements its own C<killpg> by scanning for processes in the
specified process group, which may not mean exactly the same thing as a Unix
process group, but allows us to send a signal to a parent (or master) process
and all of its sub-processes.  At the perl level, this means we can now send a
negative pid like so:

    kill SIGKILL, -$pid;

to signal all processes in the same group as C<$pid>.

=back

=item Win32

=over

=item *

A new build option C<USE_NO_REGISTRY> has been added to the makefiles.  This
option is off by default, meaning the default is to do Windows registry
lookups.  This option stops Perl from looking inside the registry for anything.
For what values are looked up in the registry see L<perlwin32>.  Internally, in
C, the name of this option is C<WIN32_NO_REGISTRY>.

=item *

The behavior of Perl using C<HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl> and
C<HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl> to lookup certain values, including C<%ENV>
vars starting with C<PERL> has changed.  Previously, the 2 keys were checked
for entries at all times through Perl processes life time even if they did not
exist.  For performance reasons, now, if the root key (i.e.
C<HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl> or C<HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl>) does
not exist at process start time, it will not be checked again for C<%ENV>
override entries for the remainder of the Perl processes life.  This more
closely matches Unix behaviour in that the environment is copied or inherited
on startup and changing the variable in the parent process or another process
or editing F<.bashrc> will not change the environmental variable in other
existing, running, processes.

=item *

One glob fetch was removed for each C<-X> or C<stat> call whether done from
Perl code or internally from Perl's C code.  The glob being looked up was
C<${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}> which is a special variable.  This makes C<-X> and
C<stat> slightly faster.

=item *

During miniperl's process startup, during the build process, 4 to 8 IO calls

=item EBCDIC C<cmp()> and C<sort()> fixed for UTF-EBCDIC strings

Comparing two strings that were both encoded in UTF-8 (or more
precisely, UTF-EBCDIC) did not work properly until now.  Since C<sort()>
uses C<cmp()>, this fixes that as well.

=item EBCDIC C<tr///> and C<y///> fixed for C<\N{}>, and C<S<use utf8>> ranges

Perl v5.22 introduced the concept of portable ranges to regular
expression patterns.  A portable range matches the same set of
characters no matter what platform is being run on.  This concept is now
extended to C<tr///>.  See
C<L<trE<sol>E<sol>E<sol>|perlop/trE<sol>SEARCHLISTE<sol>REPLACEMENTLISTE<sol>cdsr>>.

There were also some problems with these operations under S<C<use

=head1 Internal Changes

=item *

C<< sv_ref() >> is now part of the API.

=item *

L<perlapi/sv_backoff> had its return type changed from C<int> to C<void>.  It
previously has always returned C<0> since Perl 5.000 stable but that was
undocumented.  Although C<sv_backoff> is marked as public API, XS code is not
expected to be impacted since the proper API call would be through public API
C<sv_setsv(sv, &PL_sv_undef)>, or quasi-public C<SvOOK_off>, or non-public
C<SvOK_off> calls, and the return value of C<sv_backoff> was previously a
meaningless constant that can be rewritten as C<(sv_backoff(sv),0)>.

=item *

The C<EXTEND> and C<MEXTEND> macros have been improved to avoid various issues
with integer truncation and wrapping.  In particular, some casts formerly used
within the macros have been removed.  This means for example that passing an
unsigned nitems argument is likely to raise a compiler warning now (it's always
been documented to require a signed value; formerly int, lately SSize_t).

=item *

C<\b{sb}> works much better.  In Perl v5.22.0, this new construct didn't
seem to give the expected results, yet passed all the tests in the
extensive suite furnished by Unicode.  It turns out that it was because
these were short input strings, and the failures had to do with longer
inputs.  This was fixed in Perl 5.23.4, but the improvement was not
noticed until after that was released, so is included here now.

expression was useless, but then caused the parser to skip it;
this caused the surplus quantifier to be silently ignored, instead
of throwing an error. This is now fixed. [perl #126253]

=item *

The switch to building non-XS modules last in win32/makefile.mk (introduced
by design as part of the changes to enable parallel building) caused the
build of POSIX to break due to problems with the version module. This
is now fixed.

=item *

Improved parsing of hex float constants.

=item *

Fixed an issue with C<< pack >> where C<< pack "H" >> (and C<< pack "h" >>)
could read past the source when given a non-utf8 source, and a utf8 target.
[perl #126325]

=item *

Fixed several cases where perl would abort due to a segmentation fault,
or a C-level assert. [perl #126615], [perl #126602], [perl #126193].

=item *

There were places in regular expression patterns where comments (C<(?#...)>)
weren't allowed, but should have been.  This is now fixed.
L<[perl #116639]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116639>

=item *

Some regressions from Perl 5.20 have been fixed, in which some syntax errors in
L<C<(?[...])>|perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes> constructs
within regular expression patterns could cause a segfault instead of a proper
error message.
L<[perl #126180]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126180>
L<[perl #126404]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126404>

=item *

Another problem with
L<C<(?[...])>|perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes>
constructs has been fixed wherein things like C<\c]> could cause panics.
L<[perl #126181]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126181>

=item *

Some problems with attempting to extend the perl stack to around 2G or 4G
entries have been fixed.  This was particularly an issue on 32-bit perls built
to use 64-bit integers, and was easily noticeable with the list repetition
operator, e.g.

    @a = (1) x $big_number

Formerly perl may have crashed, depending on the exact value of C<$big_number>;
now it will typically raise an exception.
L<[perl #125937]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125937>

=item *

In a regex conditional expression C<(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)>, if
the condition is C<(?!)> then perl failed the match outright instead of
matching the no-pattern.  This has been fixed.
L<[perl #126222]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126222>

=item *

The special backtracking control verbs C<(*VERB:ARG)> now all allow an optional
argument and set C<REGERROR>/C<REGMARK> appropriately as well.
L<[perl #126186]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126186>

=item *

Several bugs, including a segmentation fault, have been fixed with the bounds
checking constructs (introduced in Perl 5.22) C<\b{gcb}>, C<\b{sb}>, C<\b{wb}>,
C<\B{gcb}>, C<\B{sb}>, and C<\B{wb}>.  All the C<\B{}> ones now match an empty
string; none of the C<\b{}> ones do.
L<[perl #126319]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126319>

=item *

Duplicating a closed file handle for write no longer creates a
filename of the form F<GLOB(0xXXXXXXXX)>.  [perl #125115]

=item *

Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack.  This
prevents infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes
rewinding of the stack.  [perl #123398]

=item * 

In perl v5.22.0, the logic changed when parsing a numeric parameter to the -C
option, such that the successfully parsed number was not saved as the option
value if it parsed to the end of the argument.  [perl #125381]

=item *

The PadlistNAMES macro is an lvalue again.

=item *

Zero -DPERL_TRACE_OPS memory for sub-threads.

perl_clone_using() was missing Zero init of PL_op_exec_cnt[].  This
caused sub-threads in threaded -DPERL_TRACE_OPS builds to spew exceedingly
large op-counts at destruct.  These counts would print %x as "ABABABAB",
clearly a mem-poison value.

=item *

A leak in the XS typemap caused one scalar to be leaked each time a C<FILE *>
or a C<PerlIO *> was C<OUTPUT:>ed or imported to Perl, since perl 5.000. These
particular typemap entries are thought to be extremely rarely used by XS
modules. [perl #124181]

=item *

C<alarm()> and C<sleep()> will now warn if the argument is a negative number
and return undef. Previously they would pass the negative value to the
underlying C function which may have set up a timer with a surprising value.

=item *

Perl can again be compiled with any Unicode version.  This used to
(mostly) work, but was lost in v5.18 through v5.20.  The property
C<Name_Alias> did not exist prior to Unicode 5.0.  L<Unicode::UCD>
incorrectly said it did.  This has been fixed.

=item *

Very large code-points (beyond Unicode) in regular expressions no
longer cause a buffer overflow in some cases when converted to UTF-8.
L<[perl #125826]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125826>

=item *

The integer overflow check for the range operator (...) in list
context now correctly handles the case where the size of the range is
larger than the address space.  This could happen on 32-bits with
-Duse64bitint.
L<[perl #125781]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125781>

=item *

A crash with C<< %::=(); J->${\"::"} >> has been fixed.
L<[perl #125541]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125541>

=item *

C<qr/(?[ () ])/> no longer segfaults, giving a syntax error message instead.
[perl #125805]

=item *

Regular expression possessive quantifier v5.20 regression now fixed.
C<qr/>I<PAT>C<{>I<min>,I<max>C<}+>C</> is supposed to behave identically
to C<qr/(?E<gt>>I<PAT>C<{>I<min>,I<max>C<})/>.  Since v5.20, this didn't
work if I<min> and I<max> were equal.  [perl #125825]

=item *

C<< BEGIN <> >> no longer segfaults and properly produces an error
message.  [perl #125341]

=item *

In C<tr///> an illegal backwards range like C<tr/\x{101}-\x{100}//> was
not always detected, giving incorrect results.  This is now fixed.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
